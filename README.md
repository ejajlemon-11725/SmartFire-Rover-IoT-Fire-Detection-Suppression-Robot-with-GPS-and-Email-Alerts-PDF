### *An IoT-Based Autonomous Fire Detection & Suppression Robot with GPS Localization and Real-Time Email Alerts*

> **A research-based IoT and Embedded Systems project developed as part of the CSE 422: Embedded Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific.**

## 📖 Overview

**SmartFire Rover** is an autonomous indoor firefighting robot designed to detect, locate, suppress, and report fire incidents with minimal human intervention.

Unlike conventional Arduino-based firefighting robots that rely solely on flame detection, SmartFire Rover introduces a **dual-sensor validation mechanism** to significantly reduce false alarms. Once a fire is confirmed, the rover autonomously navigates toward the source, extinguishes it using an onboard water pump, records the GPS location, and immediately sends a real-time email notification containing the fire location and emergency information.

The project combines **Embedded Systems**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **Autonomous Robotics**, and **Wireless Communication** into a practical low-cost firefighting solution for early-stage indoor fires.

# 🚀 Key Innovations

Unlike traditional firefighting robots, SmartFire Rover provides:

* **Dual-Sensor Fire Validation**

  * Prevents false alarms caused by sunlight or artificial lighting.
  * Water is released only after confirming both flame and abnormal temperature. 

* **GPS-Based Incident Localization**

  * Captures the exact latitude and longitude of the fire using a NEO-6M GPS module. 

* **Automated Emergency Email Alerts**

  * Sends an email containing:

    * Fire temperature
    * GPS coordinates
    * Google Maps link
    * Emergency fire service number (199)
